## Goals
In securing our system, we focused on two high-level goals:
* Availability
* Integrity

## Approach
To improve the security of our system in a structured approach we combine two methods: _Threat modelling_[Â¹](#footnotes) using the STRIDE framework and _Abuser stories_[Â²](#footnotes).

Additionally we checked the [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) to avoid common security risks.

We also used the [BURP Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp) to catch low-hanging fruits.

## Personas

### John
John is a non-authenticated user. He can:
* Navigate through artworks;
* See other users' profiles;
* See sale history.

### Amy
Amy is a registered user, but not an approved creator. She can do everything that John can do and:
* Place bids on auctions;
* Buy artworks that are for sale;
* Create an auction or a fixed sale for an artwork she owns.

### Sara
Sara is an approved creator. She can do everything that Sara can do and:
* She can create new artworks.

## Threat model

### Disable GraphQL Introspection
John, Amy, or Sara wants to run a malicious mutation on the server
* Protection
	- [x] Disabling introspection in production.
* Detection
	- [ ] Logged to the log console.
* Response
    - We know who run the request
    - TODO: We ban the ip

### Limiting Graphql queries depth
John, Amy, or Sara runs a malicious deeply nested query to overload the server
* Protection
    - [x] Limit query depth to 5.
* Detection
	- [ ] The malicious query is logged.
* Response
    - TODO: If the user tries to make too many malicious queries we temporarely ban them

### Limit GraphQL query complexity
John, Amy, or Sara can try to overload the the database instance by running malicious resolvers
* Protection
    - [x] With disabled introspection, the user cannot see which resolvers are available by visiting the graphql endpoint;
	- [x] A Query complexity limit is in place, which calculates the query complexity based on the number of values, object, and lists it contains. It then blocks queries with a complexity higher than 2000.
* Detection
	- [ ] The malicious query is logged.
* Response
	- TODO: If the user tries to make too many malicious queries we temporarely ban them

### Adding Request Security headers

* Protection
    - [ ]
* Detection
    - [ ]
* Response
    - 
### Logging and Monitoring

* Protection
    - [ ]
* Detection
    - [ ]
* Response
    - 

### Security issues in dependencies

* Protection
    - [ ]
* Detection
    - [ ]
* Response
    - 

### SQL injection

* Protection
    - [ ]
* Detection
    - [ ]
* Response
    - 

### Too verbose error messages

* Protection
    - [ ]
* Detection
    - [ ]
* Response
    -
